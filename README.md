hi, I'm Harrison 😁 🙋🏻‍♂  

📚👨🏻‍💻 I study math and computer science at the University of Utah. I like math, python, and data stuff, but lately I've been playing around with smart contract development, machine learning, and cryptography.  

Some cool courses that I've taken so far are data structures and algorithms with java, intro to probability, software practice 1 with c#, particle physics simulation with python, discrete math, and applied statistics 1 & 2 with R. In addition to these courses, I have been learning about neural networks via undergraduate research with Dr. Braxton Osting.

In the upcoming semesters, I'm really excited to take number theory, intro to data science, stochastic processes, mathematical optimization, cryptography, and algorithms, to name a few.
